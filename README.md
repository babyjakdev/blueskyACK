openjdk (make sure you have the java compiler installed and not only java on your system) [https://adoptium.net/]

clojure [https://clojure.org/]

leningen [https://leiningen.org/]

firefox and geckodriver [https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases]

or you can try to install automatically all of the above by running this command inside the cmd "

SETUP:

After correctly installing the needed soyware download the code (click on the green "<> Code" button and then download zip), once you extracted the folder edit the "message(.txt)" file, thats the message that is going to be posted over and over, after you did it insert any image from your soyfolder inside "img", in each upload a random image will be selected and ubloaded (DO NOT PLACE VIDEOS AS IM PRETTY SURE THEY WON'T WORK AT ALL!)

RUNNING:

BEFORE RUNNING THE PROGRAM MAKE SURE YOU ALREADY CREATED AN ACCOUNT!

Finally to run the software double click on "startcommand(.bat)", it will start a cmd in the local directory, once its open type the following command:

lein run NAME PASS PPS

lein run is to simply start up the program, NAME is either the username or email associated with the account, PASS is the password and PPS is how many seconds to wait before making another post.

example: lein run babytjak@cacasoob.com secretpassword 5
